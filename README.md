## Things that could be improved

### First item title

Description

### Takeover ad behavior

* __Device/OS:__ iPad Mini / iOS 9.x.x | iPhone 6 / iOS 9.x.x
* __App/browser:__ Twitter in-app browser, Facebook in-app browser, Chrome, Safari, Slack in-app browser
* __Problem:__ Takeover ad delayed long enough for reader to be 3-4 paragraphs into story before ad appears. When ad appears, it scrolls the page to the top and does not return to the reader's place when the ad is closed. Additionally, in some instances, closing the ad fails to remove the freeze on scrolling, leaving the article unreadable.

### Fixed header behavior

* __Device/OS:__ iPad Mini / iOS 9.x.x | iPhone 6 / iOS 9.x.x
* __App/browser:__ Twitter in-app browser, Facebook in-app browser, Chrome, Safari, Slack in-app browser
* __Problem:__ Scrolling is jumpy as the fixed header height changes when it is off the top of the screen, when you scroll down, then back up, then begin scrolling down again.

### Ad slowness

* __Device/OS:__ iPad Mini / iOS 9.x.x | iPhone 6 / iOS 9.x.x
* __App/browser:__ Twitter in-app browser, Facebook in-app browser, Chrome, Safari, Slack in-app browser
* __Problem:__ Ads load so slowly that content appears to "jump" around as the page adjust constantly.

### Ad duplication

* __Device/OS:__ iPad Mini / iOS 9.x.x | iPhone 6 / iOS 9.x.x
* __App/browser:__ Twitter in-app browser, Facebook in-app browser, Chrome, Safari, Slack in-app browser
* __Problem:__ Doubled-up cube ads in the middle of the story create a space where no content is visible on screen on most handheld devices, which could signal the end of the story to some readers and defeat the recirculation-driving tools further down the page, as well as causing them to miss information.

### "Content can't be displayed"

* __Device/OS:__ iPad Mini / iOS 9.x.x | iPhone 6 / iOS 9.x.x
* __App/browser:__ Twitter in-app browser, Facebook in-app browser, Chrome, Safari, Slack in-app browser
* __Problem:__ With alarming frequency, the article simply won't load and appear to return either _HTTP 408 Request Timeout_ or _HTTP 503 Service Unavailable_ errors.
